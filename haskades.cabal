        Autogeneration of bindings for creating BlackBerry Cascades apps
        with Haskell back ends.
        .
        Run as:
        .
        > ./haskades HaskadesBinding.hs haskades_run.cpp haskades_run.h < Types.hs
        .
        Where Types.hs is a Haskell file containing a a sum type declaration
        named 'SignalToUI' and another named 'SignalFromUI'  which fully
        specify the communication possible between the UI layer (which you
        write in QML) and the Haskell backend.  QML code can access these
        signals on the 'app' context object.  Haskell code can emit
        signals by using the 'emit' function exported from the generated
        HaskadesBinding.  The 'emit' call is threadsafe.
        .
        Text, Lazy Text, and String all end up as QString so that QML can
        work with them properly, and vice-versa.  UTCTime becomes QDateTime.
        Int, Double, and () are passed through fairly directly.  Other types
        may have support added as there is need.
        .
